This project aims to predict apartment prices in Brussels area using data collected from real estate website.<br/>
Data collection has been performed using web scrappers based on *selenium* framework.<br/>
In order to accelerate data collection and free up local computer cpu, the scrapper has been running on google cloud instances (*GCP*).<br/>
The data processing, cleaning, feature enginnering is performed using machine learning *sklearn* library and *pandas*.<br/>
The model performs well using *XGBoost Regressor* without hyperparameter tuning.<br/>
Hyperparameters had been tuned using bayesian optimization *GPyOpt* Library [GPyOpt](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPyOpt).<br/>
The final model achieves RMSE of **60kâ‚¬**.
